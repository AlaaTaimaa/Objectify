# Objectify
The first mobile 3D scanner for Android.

With this app you can capture 3D models of yourself, friends or family members and share the results afterwards. Objectify uses the front-facing camera and the smartphone display to create light reflections to calculate a 3D model from the picture.
  You can achieve best results in a very dark environment.
